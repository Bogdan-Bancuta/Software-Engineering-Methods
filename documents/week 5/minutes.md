|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Do you think 2 repos for the activity microservice are fine? | Yes   |
| Does using the builder pattern sound good? | Yes |
| Can we use commons? | Yes, it's a design decision |
| Should we use DTOs? | Yes, it's a design decision |

## Observations from the TA
- The meeting next week will be at the same time.
- For testing create a token that is valid for a long time.

## Feedback for assignment:
- The uml looks nice, almost what was intended to be done
- The microservices should have the components label not service in uml diagram, and model controllers and services inside microservices

## How to do activity microservice:
- Create entity for each activity tab and have 2 different repositories, scalability doesn't apply to this
- For notifications send emails
